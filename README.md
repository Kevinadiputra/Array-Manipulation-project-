# Array Manipulation - Data Array Management System

**Project Description:**

This repository showcases a Java-based data array management system designed to address specific challenges related to working with arrays of different data types, including integers, strings, and doubles. The project is aimed at enhancing your array handling skills, providing a practical context for working with data arrays.

**Key Features:**

1. **Show All Data**: View and manage arrays containing data records with various data types.

2. **Insert Data**: Add new data records to the arrays, incorporating integers, strings, and doubles.

3. **Edit Data**: Modify existing data records within the arrays, updating their information.

4. **Delete Data**: Remove unwanted data records from the arrays.

**Problem Scenario:**

The main challenge this project tackles is effective array management across different data types. It provides a comprehensive solution for working with data arrays and arrays of other data types, strengthening your array manipulation skills.

**How to Use the Array Manipulation System:**

1. Execute the Java file to run the program.

2. The system will present a menu with various options for array manipulation.

3. Choose an operation by entering the corresponding number.

4. Follow the prompts to interact with the arrays and manipulate data records.

5. The system will provide feedback based on the chosen operation.

6. You can continue to manage arrays or choose the "Exit" option to close the program.

**Data Structures:**

- The project employs various arrays to manage data records effectively, allowing the use of different data types, such as integers, strings, and doubles, within the arrays.
